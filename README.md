## Friday Reports

Hosted here: https://reports.aherriot.com/

Employees can submit their report every Friday.
Boss can view reports submitted in the past week, all reports a specific employee has submitted over time, and a list of employees who have not submitted a report in the past 7 days, so boss can send them a reminder,

Emailjs is used to send out emails. I chose this tool because it was super simple to set up, but I understand serviceId and templateId are transmitted over the network and may not be safe.

This project is written in React, with hooks only. No class components.

Authentication has not been implemented.<img width="526" alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 3 09 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8367301/121414861-1d7b4680-c935-11eb-9827-5c6fed450d2c.png">

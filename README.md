## Friday Reports

Hosted here: reports.aherriot.com

Employees can submit their report every Friday.
Boss can view reports submitted in the past week, all reports a specific employee has submitted over time, and a list of employees who have not submitted a report in the past 7 days, so boss can send them a reminder,

Emaijs is used to send out emails. I chose this tool because it was super simple to set up, but I understand serviceId and templateId are transmitted over the network and may not be safe.

This project is written in React, with hooks only. No class components.
